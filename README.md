# FournitureScolaire
Description
This project is a school supplies application developed using Flutter for the front-end and MongoDB for the database.

The application aims to provide a convenient platform for managing and purchasing school supplies. It offers a user-friendly interface built with Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building mobile applications. Flutter allows for seamless development and deployment on both iOS and Android platforms, providing a consistent user experience across devices.

The data is stored and managed using MongoDB, a NoSQL document database. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it suitable for handling the dynamic nature of school supply data.
